# Pathway-Level Modeling of Antibiotic-Induced Functional Perturbation in the Gut Metatranscriptome
This repository contains an interpretable machine learning framework for modeling antibiotic-specific functional perturbations in the gut microbiome using metatranscriptomic data. Rather than relying on taxonomic abundance or raw sequence features, the project operates at the level of KEGG and Gene Ontology (GO) pathways, capturing coordinated microbial functional responses to antibiotic exposure (amoxicillin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin). The pipeline includes metatranscriptomic preprocessing, functional annotation, pathway aggregation, supervised modeling, and SHAP-based interpretability, with a strong emphasis on ecological reasoning, reproducibility, and biological coherence.
